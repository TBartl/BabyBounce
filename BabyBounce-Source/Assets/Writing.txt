My son, why do you search for death so eagerly?
No, it is not death you seek. I see it clearly now; you seek to gain the power of the spikes.
Your greed is naiive and unwavering; I see now that I can not stop you.
But heed my warning: everything has a price. What are you willing to sacrifice? 
Your blood? Your humanity? Even your soul?
